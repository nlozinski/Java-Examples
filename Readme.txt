This is a project done for my Software Engineering course at George Washington University. DotPanel.java is the instructor’s starter code, but the rest was done by yours truly. It is meant to “simulate” a zombie apocalypse, where the zombies and humans move at random, unless the zombie is in close proximity to a human when it will “chase” it. When a human is attacked it becomes a zombie. The city is randomly drawn with walls that block the movements of the humans and zombies. There is a GUI built to start and stop the simulation. You may place zombies anywhere on the map by clicking at anytime.
